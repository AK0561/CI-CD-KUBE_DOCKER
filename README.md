## Problem Statement
The current deployment process faces several challenges:
1. **Continuous Deployment Requests**: The operations team is overwhelmed with deployment requests, leading to delays and errors.
2. **Manual Deployment Dependencies**: Manual processes create dependencies that slow down the overall workflow.
3. **Time-Consuming Procedures**: The existing deployment process is time-intensive, affecting development speed.

## Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, we propose to:
1. **Automate Build and Release**: Implement a streamlined automation process for building and releasing applications.
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Enable Docker image builds and deployments in real-time as code commits are made.
3. **Reduce Manual Intervention**: Minimize human error and improve efficiency through automated workflows.

## Tools Used
This project utilizes the following tools:
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration and management of containerized applications.
- **Docker**: The container runtime for packaging applications.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD server for automating the deployment pipeline.
- **Docker Hub**: Container registry for storing Docker images.
- **Helm**: Package manager for deploying applications on Kubernetes.
- **Git**: Version control system for source code management.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool primarily for Java projects.
- **SonarQube**: Code quality analysis server to ensure best practices.

## Flow of Execution
1. **Continuous Integration Setup**: Integrate Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus for CI.
2. **Containerization**: Set up a Docker Hub account for storing images.
3. **Store Credentials**: Securely store Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins.
4. **Jenkins Configuration**:
   - Setup Docker Engine in Jenkins.
   - Install necessary plugins (e.g., Docker Pipeline, Docker, Pipeline Utility).
5. **Kubernetes Cluster Creation**: Use Kops to create a Kubernetes cluster.
6. **Helm Installation**: Install Helm on the Kops VM for package management.
7. **Helm Charts Creation**: Develop Helm charts for application deployment.
8. **Testing Charts**: Deploy and test Helm charts in the Kubernetes cluster.
9. **Jenkins Slave Configuration**: Add Kops VM as a Jenkins slave for deployment tasks.
10. **Pipeline Code Creation**: Write declarative pipeline code in Jenkins.
11. **Git Repository Update**:
    - Include Helm charts, Dockerfile, and Jenkinsfile in the repository.
12. **Jenkins Job Creation**: Set up a Jenkins job for the CI/CD pipeline.
13. **Job Execution**: Run and validate the Jenkins job to ensure successful deployments.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AK0561/CI-CD-KUBE_DOCKER.git
   cd CI-CD-KUBE_DOCKER
   ```
2. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Docker and Kubernetes (with Kops) installed.
   - Install Jenkins and SonarQube.
3. **Configure Jenkins**:
   - Install necessary plugins as mentioned in the Flow of Execution.
   - Create Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins.
4. **Create and Configure Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Use Kops to create a cluster and configure Helm.
5. **Deploy Your Application**:
   - Follow the instructions in the Jenkins pipeline to build and deploy your application.

## Usage
- Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process.
- Monitor the build and deployment process through Jenkins' dashboard.
- Access the deployed application via the Kubernetes service endpoints.
